# Gemfile description
- sinatra allows us to use the Sinatra DSL (Domain Specific Language) in our app.

- <b>rake</b> is used to run automated tasks, like creating and migrating the database.

- <b>sqlite3 </b>is the database we will be using to store data.

- <b>activerecord</b> is the interface the app uses to communicate with the database.

- <b>sinatra-activerecord</b> is a bridge that allows us to use Active Record in a Sinatra application.

- <b>tux</b> allows us to interact with the database through the command line.

- <b>sinatra-contrib</b> will reload our app, so we donâ€™t have to stop and start the server whenever a minor change is made.
