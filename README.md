#Gemfile description
sinatra allows us to use the Sinatra DSL (Domain Specific Language) in our app.

rake is used to run automated tasks, like creating and migrating the database.

sqlite3 is the database we will be using to store data.

activerecord is the interface the app uses to communicate with the database.

sinatra-activerecord is a bridge that allows us to use Active Record in a Sinatra application.

tux allows us to interact with the database through the command line.

sinatra-contrib will reload our app, so we donâ€™t have to stop and start the server whenever a minor change is made.
